# Abstract
Models of price direction forecasting through deep learning algorithms
live at the frontier of quantitative finance. In this project we develop an LSTM/GRU
based binary classification neural network aimed at 5-days price direction forecasting
for Advanced Micro Devices and JP Morgan stocks. We perform feature extraction
and selection to address multicollinearity. Subsequently, we implement a deep learning
architecture and hypertune its parameter through Bayesian optimisation. We evaluate
the model through standard metrics like accuracy, F1-score and ROC curves. We find
that the model is subject to slight overfitting but produces satisfying results.
